# A - Team Ground Rule

1. Be on time for team meetings. If you will be late for some reason, let other team members know a ahead, as soon as you can.
2. Be prepared for the day's meeting agenda. Do some pre-reading.
3. Give everyone opportunity to talk during the meeting.
4. Respect other team member's opinion.
5. In case of a conflict, team members will vote. Majority's decision is final.
6. If a task is taken by one team members but for some reason task completion is getting delayed and we ae close to the sprint deadline, another team member can step up and help/or complete the task by him/herself. We will resolve any conflict or difference by discussion. Our goal is to maximize the team output.
